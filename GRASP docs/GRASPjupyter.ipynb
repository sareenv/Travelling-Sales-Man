        "The GRASP metaheuristic was developed in late 1980’s (Feo and Resende, 1989). Since then it was under continuous development, and GRASP was applied to many problem areas such as Travelling Salesman Problem. GRASP is a general, metaheuristic, high level procedure used to ﬁnd good (ideally optimal) solution to computationally diﬃcult combinatorial optimization problems. (Darby-Dowman and Consoli, 2006) It is an iterative (or multi-start) process, with each iteration consisting of construction phase and local search phase.\n"

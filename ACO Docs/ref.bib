abstract = "In this paper we present an extension of ant colony optimization (ACO) to continuous domains. We show how ACO, which was initially developed to be a metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization, can be adapted to continuous optimization without any major conceptual change to its structure. We present the general idea, implementation, and results obtained. We compare the results with those reported in the literature for other continuous optimization methods: other ant-related approaches and other metaheuristics initially developed for combinatorial optimization and later adapted to handle the continuous case. We discuss how our extended ACO compares to those algorithms, and we present some analysis of its efficiency and robustness."

abstract = "In this paper we present an extension of ant colony optimization (ACO) to continuous domains. We show how ACO, which was initially developed to be a metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization, can be adapted to continuous optimization without any major conceptual change to its structure. We present the general idea, implementation, and results obtained. We compare the results with those reported in the literature for other continuous optimization methods: other ant-related approaches and other metaheuristics initially developed for combinatorial optimization and later adapted to handle the continuous case. We discuss how our extended ACO compares to those algorithms, and we present some analysis of its efficiency and robustness."

abstract = "The paper presents results on the runtime complexity of two ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms: ant system, the oldest ACO variant, and GBAS, the first ACO variant for which theoretical convergence results have been established. In both cases, as the class of test problems under consideration, a slight generalization of the well-known OneMax test function has been chosen. The techniques used for the runtime analysis of the two algorithms differ: in the case of GBAS, the expected runtime until the optimal solution is reached is studied by a direct bound estimation approach inspired by comparable results for the (1+1) evolutionary algorithm (EA). A runtime bound of order O(mlogm), where m is the problem instance size, is obtained. In the case of ant system, the original discrete stochastic process is approximated by a suitable continuous deterministic process. The validity of the approximation is shown by means of a rigid convergence theorem exploiting a classical result from mathematical learning theory. Using this approximation, it is demonstrated that for the considered OneMax-type problems, a runtime of order O(mlog(1/ε)) until reaching an expected relative solution quality of 1-ε, and a runtime of O(mlogm) until reaching the optimal solution with high probability can be predicted. Our results are the first to show competitiveness in runtime complexity with (1+1) EA on OneMax for a proper ACO algorithm."
